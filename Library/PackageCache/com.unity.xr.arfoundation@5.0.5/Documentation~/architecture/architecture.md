# Architecture

Software architecture refers to the structures of a software system. As an AR Foundation user, you can make more informed decisions about how to build your app by understanding the elements of the AR Foundation architecture, their responsibilities, and how they interact with each other.

The table below explains the key elements of the AR Foundation architecture:

| Topic | Description |
| :---- | :---------- |
| [Subsystems](xref:arfoundation-subsystems) | Understand how Unity abstracts platform-specific code. |
| [Managers](xref:arfoundation-managers) | Understand how AR Foundation makes subsystem data accessible in scenes. |
| [Extensions](xref:arfoundation-extensions) | Write platform-specific code using AR Foundation native pointers. |
