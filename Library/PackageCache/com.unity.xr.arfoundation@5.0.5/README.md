# AR Foundation

Use the AR Foundation package to add high-level functionality for working with augmented reality. Unity 2018.1 includes built-in multi-platform support for AR. These APIs are in the `UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems` namespace, and consist of a number of `Subsystem`s, e.g., `XRPlaneSubsystem`. Several XR Subsystems comprise the low-level API for interacting with AR. The **AR Foundation** package wraps this low-level API into a cohesive whole and enhances it with additional utilities, such as AR session lifecycle management and the creation of `GameObject`s to represent detected features in the environment.
