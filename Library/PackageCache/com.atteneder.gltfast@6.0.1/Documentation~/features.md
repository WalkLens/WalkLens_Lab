<sup>1</sup>: Physically-Based Rendering (PBR) material model

<sup>2</sup>: Two sets of texture coordinates (as required by the glTF 2.0 specification) are supported, but not three or more ([issue][UVSets])

<sup>3</sup>: Only supports Universal Render Pipeline versions >= 12.0; Only coat mask and smoothness are supported, other coat related properties, such as coat normal, are not supported

<sup>4</sup>: There are two approximation implementations for transmission in Universal render pipeline. If the Opaque Texture is enabled (in the Universal RP Asset settings), it is sampled to provide proper transmissive filtering. The downside of this approach is transparent objects are not rendered on top of each other. If the opaque texture is not available, the common approximation (see <sup>4</sup> below) is used.

<sup>5</sup>: Transmission in Built-In and HD render pipeline does not support transmission textures and is only 100% correct in certain cases like clear glass (100% transmission, white base color). Otherwise it's an approximation.

### Material Export

Material export is currently only tested on the following shaders:

- Universal and High Definition render pipeline
  - `Lit`
  - `Unlit`
- Built-In render pipeline
  - `Standard`
  - `Unlit`

Other shaders might (partially) work if they have similar properties (with identical names).

## Data-Oriented Technology Stack

> ⚠️ Note: DOTS is highly experimental and many features don't work yet. Do not use it for production ready projects!

Unity's [Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS)][DOTS] allows users to create high performance gameplay. *Unity glTFast* has experimental import support for it.

Instead of traditional GameObjects, *Unity glTFast* will instantiate [Entities][Entities] and render them via [Entities Graphics][EntitiesGraphics].

Possibly incomplete list of things that are known to not work with Entities yet:

- Animation
- Skinning
- Morph targets
- Cameras
- Lights

### DOTS Setup

- Install the [Entities Graphics][EntitiesGraphics] package
- Use `GltfEntityAsset` instead of `GltfAsset`
- For customized behavior, use the `EntityInstantiator` instead of the `GameObjectInstantiator`

## Unity Version Support

*Unity glTFast* requires Unity 2020.1 or newer.

## Legend

- ✅ Fully supported
- ☑️ Partially supported
- ℹ️ Planned (click for issue)
- ⛔️ No plan to support (click for issue)
- `?`: Unknown / Untested
- `n/a`: Not available
